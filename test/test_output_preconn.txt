Looking at these 5 words: GAME, PRAGUE, BERLIN, COPENHAGEN, BRUSSELS. I'll check which category connects 4 of them.

Category types:
- Semantic Taxonomy - types of X, parts of Y, members of category
- Semantic Synonymy - words with similar meanings
- Semantic Association - items linked by shared scenario/function
- Named Entities - proper names (people, places, brands, titles)
- Collocational/Idiomatic - fill slots in phrases (___X, Y___)

I notice that PRAGUE, BERLIN, COPENHAGEN, and BRUSSELS are all capital cities in Europe. This fits under the "Named Entities" category, specifically as proper names of places, and more precisely as European capitals. GAME, however, is a common noun referring to a form of play or sport, and does not belong to this group.

Therefore, the odd word out is: GAME
