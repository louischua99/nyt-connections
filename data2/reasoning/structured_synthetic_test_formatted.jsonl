I notice that BANDS, BENCH, ELLIPTICAL, and TREADMILL all seem related to fitness or exercise. Could these be types of gym equipment? Let me check: BANDS often refers to resistance bands used in workouts, BENCH is a weight bench, ELLIPTICAL is an elliptical machine, and TREADMILL is a treadmill. This fits under Semantic Taxonomy \u2013 they are all members of the category \"gym equipment.\" So, that seems like a solid group.\n\nNow, with those four words set aside, I have BEHIND, ON, THROUGH, UNDER, INTERIOR, RIGHT, SUPPLEMENTARY, VERTICAL, COURT, GUEST, WARE, WHITE. Next, I see BEHIND, ON, THROUGH, and UNDER. These look like prepositions, specifically indicating spatial relationships. Let me verify under Grammatical/Syntactic category: BEHIND means at the back of, ON means in contact with a surface, THROUGH means moving from one side to another, and UNDER means below or beneath. All are common prepositions of place. So, this group fits.\n\nAfter removing those, I'm left with INTERIOR, RIGHT, SUPPLEMENTARY, VERTICAL, COURT, GUEST, WARE, WHITE. Now, looking at INTERIOR, RIGHT, SUPPLEMENTARY, and VERTICAL \u2013 these sound like geometric terms related to angles. Let me check Semantic Taxonomy: INTERIOR angle is inside a shape, RIGHT angle is 90 degrees, SUPPLEMENTARY angles sum to 180 degrees, and VERTICAL angles are opposite each other when lines cross. Yes, all are types of angles or angle relationships. So, that group is confirmed.\n\nFinally, I have COURT, GUEST, WARE, WHITE remaining. What connects these? They might be part of compound words or phrases. Considering Collocational/Idiomatic category, they could fill slots in phrases like \"___ house.\" COURT house is a judicial building, GUEST house is a lodging, WAREhouse is for storage, and WHITE House is the US presidential residence. All form common compound words with \"house.\" So, this group makes sense.\n\nTo summarize, I've found four groups through systematic checking:\n\n- **GYM EQUIPMENT**: BANDS, BENCH, ELLIPTICAL, TREADMILL\n- **PREPOSITIONS OF PLACE**: BEHIND, ON, THROUGH, UNDER\n- **ANGLES**: INTERIOR, RIGHT, SUPPLEMENTARY, VERTICAL\n- **___HOUSE**: COURT, GUEST, WARE, WHITE\n</think>\n\n**GYM EQUIPMENT**: BANDS, BENCH, ELLIPTICAL, TREADMILL\n**PREPOSITIONS OF PLACE**: BEHIND, ON, THROUGH, UNDER\n**ANGLES**: INTERIOR, RIGHT, SUPPLEMENTARY, VERTICAL\n**___HOUSE**: COURT, GUEST, WARE, WHITE"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 152, "original_id": 152, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 3317}}

These seem related to greetings in different languages. Let me check for Cross-Linguistic connections. BONJOUR is French for \"hello,\" HOLA is Spanish for \"hello,\" SALAAM is Arabic for \"hello\" or \"peace,\" and GUTEN appears to be from German \"Guten Tag\" meaning \"good day\" or \"hello.\" So, these are all ways to say \"hello\" in various languages. That seems like a solid group.\n\nNow, with those removed, I have: BOARDWALK, SHOVEL, SWIMSUIT, UMBRELLA, CHRONIC, DIAGNOSIS, MALIGNANT, THERAPY, FIGHTING, GOLD, JELLY, SHELL.\n\nNext, I see CHRONIC, DIAGNOSIS, MALIGNANT, and THERAPY. These sound medical. Let me check for Semantic Taxonomy or Semantic Association. CHRONIC often describes a persistent medical condition, DIAGNOSIS is the process of identifying a disease, MALIGNANT is a term for cancerous growths, and THERAPY refers to treatment. So, they all belong to the medical field. This could be a group for medical terminology.\n\nAfter removing those, I'm left with: BOARDWALK, SHOVEL, SWIMSUIT, UMBRELLA, FIGHTING, GOLD, JELLY, SHELL.\n\nNow, looking at BOARDWALK, SHOVEL, SWIMSUIT, and UMBRELLA, I recall that these are commonly associated with beach activities. Let me check for Semantic Association. A BOARDWALK is often found along beaches, a SHOVEL can be used for digging sand, a SWIMSUIT is worn for swimming, and an UMBRELLA provides shade on the beach. So, these are all items or features related to a beach day.\n\nThat leaves FIGHTING, GOLD, JELLY, and SHELL. What could connect these? They might be part of compound words. Let me check for Collocational/Idiomatic patterns. I notice that each can be combined with \"fish\" to form a common term: FIGHTING fish (like betta fish), GOLDfish, JELLYfish, and SHELLfish. Yes, that fits perfectly. So, these are all words that precede \"fish\" to describe types of fish or aquatic creatures.\n\nSo my four groups are:\n\n**HELLO IN LANGUAGES**: BONJOUR, GUTEN, HOLA, SALAAM  \n**MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY**: CHRONIC, DIAGNOSIS, MALIGNANT, THERAPY  \n**BEACH DAY**: BOARDWALK, SHOVEL, SWIMSUIT, UMBRELLA  \n**___FISH**: FIGHTING, GOLD, JELLY, SHELL\n</think>\n\n**BEACH DAY**: BOARDWALK, SHOVEL, SWIMSUIT, UMBRELLA\n**MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY**: CHRONIC, DIAGNOSIS, MALIGNANT, THERAPY\n**___FISH**: FIGHTING, GOLD, JELLY, SHELL\n**HELLO IN LANGUAGES**: BONJOUR, GUTEN, HOLA, SALAAM"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 140, "original_id": 140, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 3277}}

Let me check for Semantic Taxonomy: these are all units of digital information, with BYTE as the base unit and the others being multiples (KILOBYTE, MEGABYTE, GIGABYTE). So, this group is clear: BINARY TERMS.\n\nNext, I see DARTMOUTH, DUKE, HARVARD, and PENN \u2013 these are all well-known universities. Checking for Named Entities, these are elite educational institutions, often referred to as Ivy League or top-tier schools. Dartmouth College, Duke University, Harvard University, and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) fit this category. So, that's another group: ELITE UNIVERSITIES.\n\nNow, with those two groups removed, I have GRAD, OBLAKO, RADUGA, SNEG, and AGING, BACTERIAL, DEPRESSANT, INFLAMMATORY. Looking at GRAD, OBLAKO, RADUGA, SNEG, these don't appear to be English words. I recall that in Russian, \"grad\" means hail, \"oblako\" means cloud, \"raduga\" means rainbow, and \"sneg\" means snow. This fits under Cross-Linguistic \u2013 translations of weather-related terms. So, these form a group: WEATHER IN RUSSIAN.\n\nFinally, that leaves AGING, BACTERIAL, DEPRESSANT, INFLAMMATORY. What connects these? I notice that each can be combined with the prefix \"anti-\" to form common compounds: anti-aging, antibacterial, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory. This is Collocational/Idiomatic \u2013 they fill the slot in \"anti-___\".

Let me check for Semantic Synonymy: CROSS means annoyed or angry, FURIOUS means extremely angry, INFURIATED means made very angry, and WRATHFUL means full of wrath. Yes, these are all synonyms or related terms for being angry. So, that's one group: ANGRY.\n\nWith that group found, I have 12 words left: FREEZE, SOCIAL, THEFT, VIRUS, CONCERT, CONDUCTOR, PODIUM, REHEARSAL, AGAPE, ISHQ, LIEBE, SEVGI.\n\nNext, I see CONCERT, CONDUCTOR, PODIUM, and REHEARSAL. These appear linked to orchestral or musical performances. Let me check for Semantic Association: CONCERT is a musical performance, CONDUCTOR is the person who directs the orchestra, PODIUM is where the conductor stands, and REHEARSAL is a practice session for such a performance. All share a common scenario of orchestral events. So, that's another group: ORCHESTRA SECTIONS.\n\nNow, I have 8 words left: FREEZE, SOCIAL, THEFT, VIRUS, AGAPE, ISHQ, LIEBE, SEVGI.\n\nLooking at AGAPE, ISHQ, LIEBE, and SEVGI, these seem like words from different languages. Let me check for Cross-Linguistic connections: AGAPE is Greek for love (especially unconditional love), ISHQ is Arabic for passionate love, LIEBE is German for love, and SEVGI is Turkish for love. So, these all mean \"love\" in various languages. That's a third group: LOVE IN LANGUAGES.\n\nFinally, I'm left with FREEZE, SOCIAL, THEFT, and VIRUS. What connects these? I recall that they can be combined with the prefix \"anti-\" to form common compounds. Let me check for Collocational/Idiomatic patterns: anti-freeze, anti-social, anti-theft, anti-virus.

I notice that BLANCO, NEGRO, ROJO, and ROSA are all Spanish words for colors: BLANCO means white, NEGRO means black, ROJO means red, and ROSA means pink. This seems like a Cross-Linguistic connection, as they are translations of color names from Spanish to English. So, I'll tentatively group them as colors in Spanish.\n\nNow, with those removed, I have COSMONAUT, GULAG, PERESTROIKA, TSAR, BRIGHT, HEIGHT, MIGHT, SLIGHT, ACROSS, AMONG, IN, THROUGH. Next, I see COSMONAUT, GULAG, PERESTROIKA, and TSAR. These all appear to be related to Russian culture or history. COSMONAUT is the Russian term for astronaut, GULAG refers to the Soviet labor camp system, PERESTROIKA was a political movement for restructuring in the Soviet Union, and TSAR is a title for Russian emperors. This fits under Lexical Etymology, as they are all English words borrowed from Russian. So, I'll group them as Russian loanwords.\n\nAfter removing those, I'm left with BRIGHT, HEIGHT, MIGHT, SLIGHT, ACROSS, AMONG, IN, THROUGH. Looking at BRIGHT, HEIGHT, MIGHT, and SLIGHT, I see they all end with the letters \"GHT\". This is a Lexical Orthography pattern, where they share a common spelling suffix. So, these form a group based on the \"GHT\" ending.\n\nFinally, the remaining words are ACROSS, AMONG, IN, and THROUGH. These all function as prepositions in English, specifically indicating spatial relationships or location. This falls under Grammatical/Syntactic, as they share the same part of speech. So, I'll group them as prepositions of place.\n\nTo confirm, I've verified each group:\n- Colors in Spanish: BLANCO, NEGRO, ROJO, ROSA are all color terms in Spanish.\n- Russian loanwords: COSMONAUT, GULAG, PERESTROIKA, TSAR are all derived from Russian.\n- Words with 'GHT': BRIGHT, HEIGHT, MIGHT, SLIGHT all contain the \"GHT\" letter sequence.\n- Prepositions of place: ACROSS, AMONG, IN, THROUGH are all common English prepositions.\n\nSo my four groups are:\n\n**COLORS IN SPANISH**: BLANCO, NEGRO, ROJO, ROSA  \n**RUSSIAN LOANWORDS**: COSMONAUT, GULAG, PERESTROIKA, TSAR  \n**WORDS WITH 'GHT'**: BRIGHT, HEIGHT, MIGHT, SLIGHT  \n**PREPOSITIONS OF PLACE**: ACROSS, AMONG, IN, THROUGH\n</think>\n\n**COLORS IN SPANISH**: BLANCO, NEGRO, ROJO, ROSA\n**RUSSIAN LOANWORDS**: COSMONAUT, GULAG, PERESTROIKA, TSAR\n**WORDS WITH 'GHT'**: BRIGHT, HEIGHT, MIGHT, SLIGHT\n**PREPOSITIONS OF PLACE**: ACROSS, AMONG, IN, THROUGH"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 189, "original_id": 189, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 3299}}

So, that's one group: car brands.\n\nWith those removed, I now have: HERE, LATTER, THAT, THIS, ADMIRAL, ALGORITHM, COFFEE, SUGAR, FORMAGGIO, FRUTTA, LATTE, PANE.\n\nNext, I notice FORMAGGIO, FRUTTA, LATTE, and PANE. These look like Italian words. Formaggio means \"cheese,\" frutta means \"fruit,\" latte means \"milk,\" and pane means \"bread.\" This fits under Cross-Linguistic, as they are translations of food items in Italian. So, that's another group: food in Italian.\n\nAfter removing those, I'm left with: HERE, LATTER, THAT, THIS, ADMIRAL, ALGORITHM, COFFEE, SUGAR.\n\nNow, I need to find connections among these eight words. I see HERE, LATTER, THAT, and THIS. These words are all related to demonstrative references. HERE is an adverb indicating location, THAT and THIS are demonstrative pronouns, and LATTER is an adjective used to refer to the second of two things mentioned. They all function as words that point to or specify something, which fits under Semantic Taxonomy \u2013 specifically, types of demonstratives. So, that's a group: demonstratives.\n\nFinally, the remaining words are ADMIRAL, ALGORITHM, COFFEE, and SUGAR. What do these have in common? I recall that all these words have origins in Arabic. ADMIRAL comes from Arabic \"amir-al-bahr\" meaning \"commander of the sea,\" ALGORITHM from the name of Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi via Arabic, COFFEE from Arabic \"qahwa,\" and SUGAR from Arabic \"sukkar.\" This fits under Lexical Etymology \u2013 shared language origin.

I notice ATHENA, DEMETER, HERMES, POSEIDON \u2013 these seem like names from Greek mythology. Also, AMARILLO, MARRON, ROJO, VERDE look like they might be Spanish words. HAIL, RAIN, SNOW, WIND are all weather-related, and BRIGHT, KEEN, QUICK, SHARP could be related to intelligence or speed.\n\nNow, I'll start with Named Entities since the Greek names stand out. Let me check for Named Entities: ATHENA, DEMETER, HERMES, POSEIDON. These are all figures from Greek mythology \u2013 Athena is the goddess of wisdom, Demeter is the goddess of agriculture, Hermes is the messenger god, and Poseidon is the god of the sea. Yes, they are all Greek gods. So, that gives me one group: GREEK GODS.\n\nWith that group found, I now have these 12 words left: BRIGHT, KEEN, QUICK, SHARP, HAIL, RAIN, SNOW, WIND, AMARILLO, MARRON, ROJO, VERDE.\n\nNext, I see AMARILLO, MARRON, ROJO, VERDE. These appear to be Spanish words. Let me check for Cross-Linguistic connections. AMARILLO means \"yellow\" in Spanish, MARRON means \"brown\", ROJO means \"red\", and VERDE means \"green\". So, they are all color names in Spanish. That fits under Cross-Linguistic. So, group two: COLORS IN SPANISH.\n\nNow, I have 8 words left: BRIGHT, KEEN, QUICK, SHARP, HAIL, RAIN, SNOW, WIND.\n\nLooking at HAIL, RAIN, SNOW, WIND, I recall they can be part of compound words with \"storm\". Let me check for Collocational/Idiomatic connections. Specifically, they can fill the slot in \"___ storm\": hail storm, rain storm, snow storm, wind storm. These are common phrases describing types of storms. So, that seems like a solid group: ___STORM.\n\nThat leaves me with BRIGHT, KEEN, QUICK, SHARP. Now, what connects these? They all can describe mental acuity or intelligence. Let me check for Semantic Synonymy. BRIGHT can mean intelligent, KEEN can mean sharp or perceptive, QUICK can mean mentally agile, and SHARP can mean clever or astute. So, they are synonyms for intelligence. That gives me the fourth group: INTELLIGENCE.\n\nI should verify if there are any other possible connections. For example, could BRIGHT, KEEN, QUICK, SHARP be related to light or speed? But in this context, they all share the intelligence meaning. Similarly, for HAIL, RAIN, SNOW, WIND, they are all weather phenomena, but the \"___ storm\" connection is more specific and fits the pattern. The Greek gods and Spanish colors are clear.

Testing: FRIEND becomes \"friendship\", MEMBER becomes \"membership\", PARTNER becomes \"partnership\", SPONSOR becomes \"sponsorship\". Yes, that fits perfectly. So, this group is ___SHIP: FRIEND, MEMBER, PARTNER, SPONSOR.\n\nGroup found: ___SHIP. That leaves me with these 12 words: COBRA, CORPSE, TRIANGLE, WARRIOR, BACKPACK, CRAYON, MARKER, RULER, ABBEY, BLACKBIRD, PENNY, YESTERDAY.\n\nNow, with those removed, I can see COBRA, CORPSE, TRIANGLE, and WARRIOR. These might be related to yoga or physical poses. Let me check for Semantic Taxonomy \u2013 are they types of yoga poses? I know that in yoga, there is Cobra pose, Corpse pose (Savasana), Triangle pose, and Warrior pose. Confirming: COBRA refers to cobra pose, CORPSE to corpse pose, TRIANGLE to triangle pose, WARRIOR to warrior pose. Yes, all are standard yoga poses. So, this group is YOGA POSES: COBRA, CORPSE, TRIANGLE, WARRIOR.\n\nGroup found: YOGA POSES. That leaves me with these 8 words: BACKPACK, CRAYON, MARKER, RULER, ABBEY, BLACKBIRD, PENNY, YESTERDAY.\n\nNext, looking at BACKPACK, CRAYON, MARKER, and RULER. These seem like items used in an educational context. Let me check for Semantic Taxonomy \u2013 are they school supplies? BACKPACK is a bag for carrying books, CRAYON is a coloring tool, MARKER is a writing instrument, RULER is for measuring and drawing lines. All are commonly associated with school or office supplies. So, this group is SCHOOL SUPPLIES: BACKPACK, CRAYON, MARKER, RULER.\n\nGroup found: SCHOOL SUPPLIES. That leaves me with these 4 words: ABBEY, BLACKBIRD, PENNY, YESTERDAY.\n\nWith only 4 words left, these must be connected. I recall that these are all titles of songs by the Beatles. Let me verify using Named Entities: ABBEY likely refers to \"Abbey Road\" (an album and song), BLACKBIRD is the song \"Blackbird\", PENNY is \"Penny Lane\", and YESTERDAY is the song \"Yesterday\". All are well-known Beatles songs. So, this group is BEATLES SONGS: ABBEY, BLACKBIRD, PENNY, YESTERDAY.\n\nSo my four groups are:\n\n**___SHIP**: FRIEND, MEMBER, PARTNER, SPONSOR  \n**YOGA POSES**: COBRA, CORPSE, TRIANGLE, WARRIOR  \n**SCHOOL SUPPLIES**: BACKPACK, CRAYON, MARKER, RULER  \n**BEATLES SONGS**: ABBEY, BLACKBIRD, PENNY, YESTERDAY\n</think>\n\n**___SHIP**: FRIEND, MEMBER, PARTNER, SPONSOR\n**YOGA POSES**: COBRA, CORPSE, TRIANGLE, WARRIOR\n**SCHOOL SUPPLIES**: BACKPACK, CRAYON, MARKER, RULER\n**BEATLES SONGS**: ABBEY, BLACKBIRD, PENNY, YESTERDAY"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 36, "original_id": 36, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 3592}}

I notice that WRENCH, WRINKLE, WRITE, and WRITTEN all start with \"WR,\" which might indicate a phonological or orthographic pattern. Also, EIGHTH, FIFTH, QUARTER, and TENTH seem related to numbers or fractions. BLUE, JAIL, LADY, and MOCKING might be part of compound words, and FRESHMAN, JUNIOR, SECOND, and THIRD could be academic terms.\n\nNow, I'll check for collocational or idiomatic patterns. Considering BLUE, JAIL, LADY, and MOCKING, I see that each can be combined with \"BIRD\" to form common compound words: bluebird, jailbird, ladybird, and mockingbird. This fits the pattern of filling slots in phrases, specifically \"___ BIRD.\" So, that seems like one group.\n\nNext, I'll look at phonological patterns. For WRENCH, WRINKLE, WRITE, and WRITTEN, I recall that in English, the \"W\" is silent in these words when pronounced. This is a shared sound pattern, making them silent W words. So, that's another group.\n\nMoving to semantic taxonomy, I examine EIGHTH, FIFTH, QUARTER, and TENTH. These are all fractions or parts of a whole: eighth, fifth, quarter (meaning one-fourth), and tenth. They belong to the category of fractions, so that's a clear group.\n\nWith those three groups identified, I have four words left: FRESHMAN, JUNIOR, SECOND, and THIRD. I need to find their connection. Considering semantic association, these all relate to academic grades or year levels in education. FRESHMAN is the first year, JUNIOR is the third year, and SECOND and THIRD can refer to second year and third year respectively, often used in school contexts. So, they form a group based on academic grades.\n\nTo verify, I ensure no words are left ungrouped and that each group is coherent. The groups are:\n- BLUE, JAIL, LADY, MOCKING as \"___ BIRD\" words\n- WRENCH, WRINKLE, WRITE, WRITTEN as silent W words\n- EIGHTH, FIFTH, QUARTER, TENTH as fractions\n- FRESHMAN, JUNIOR, SECOND, THIRD as academic grades\n\nSo, my four groups are:\n\n**___BIRD**: BLUE, JAIL, LADY, MOCKING  \n**SILENT W WORDS**: WRENCH, WRINKLE, WRITE, WRITTEN  \n**FRACTIONS**: EIGHTH, FIFTH, QUARTER, TENTH  \n**ACADEMIC GRADES**: FRESHMAN, JUNIOR, SECOND, THIRD\n</think>\n\n**___BIRD**: BLUE, JAIL, LADY, MOCKING\n**SILENT W WORDS**: WRENCH, WRINKLE, WRITE, WRITTEN\n**FRACTIONS**: EIGHTH, FIFTH, QUARTER, TENTH\n**ACADEMIC GRADES**: FRESHMAN, JUNIOR, SECOND, THIRD"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 60, "original_id": 60, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 2416}}

I immediately notice that LITTLE, MICROSCOPIC, MINIATURE, and PETITE all seem to relate to small size. Also, BONSAI, KIMONO, MANGA, and ORIGAMI stand out as words of Japanese origin. The words BUBBLE, COFFEE, PUZZLE, and SUMMER might share a spelling pattern, and CALL, ECHO, SOUND, SURROUND could be connected through sound or communication.\n\nNow, I'll start with Semantic Synonymy. I see LITTLE, MICROSCOPIC, MINIATURE, and PETITE. These all have similar meanings related to being small. Testing: LITTLE means small in size, MICROSCOPIC means extremely small, MINIATURE means a small-scale version, and PETITE means small and delicate, often for people. Yes, these are all synonyms for \"small\" or \"tiny.\" So, that's one group: LITTLE, MICROSCOPIC, MINIATURE, PETITE.\n\nWith that group found, I have 12 words left: CALL, ECHO, SOUND, SURROUND, BUBBLE, COFFEE, PUZZLE, SUMMER, BONSAI, KIMONO, MANGA, ORIGAMI.\n\nNext, I'll check Lexical Etymology for shared language origin. BONSAI, KIMONO, MANGA, and ORIGAMI all come from Japanese. BONSAI refers to the art of miniature trees, KIMONO is a traditional robe, MANGA is a style of comics, and ORIGAMI is paper folding. They are all Japanese loanwords in English. So, that's another group: BONSAI, KIMONO, MANGA, ORIGAMI.\n\nNow, I have 8 words remaining: CALL, ECHO, SOUND, SURROUND, BUBBLE, COFFEE, PUZZLE, SUMMER.\n\nLooking at BUBBLE, COFFEE, PUZZLE, and SUMMER, I notice they all have double consonants. Let me check Lexical Orthography: BUBBLE has double 'B', COFFEE has double 'F', PUZZLE has double 'Z', and SUMMER has double 'M'. Yes, they all contain double letters. So, that's a group based on spelling patterns: BUBBLE, COFFEE, PUZZLE, SUMMER.\n\nThat leaves me with CALL, ECHO, SOUND, and SURROUND. These must be connected. I need to find their commonality. They all relate to sound or hearing, but I think there's a more specific connection. Let me consider Wordplay Double Meaning or Semantic Association. Perhaps they are all associated with the word \"ring\" in some context. For example, CALL can mean to ring someone on the phone, ECHO can mean a ringing sound, SOUND can mean to ring a bell, and SURROUND can relate to surround sound or encircling like a ring. So, they all have meanings connected to \"ring.\" This seems to fit, as they are often used in contexts involving sound resonance or communication.\n\nThus, the final group is CALL, ECHO, SOUND, SURROUND.\n\nSo my four groups are:\n\n**SMALL**: LITTLE, MICROSCOPIC, MINIATURE, PETITE  \n**JAPANESE LOANWORDS**: BONSAI, KIMONO, MANGA, ORIGAMI  \n**DOUBLE CONSONANTS**: BUBBLE, COFFEE, PUZZLE, SUMMER  \n**RING MEANINGS**: CALL, ECHO, SOUND, SURROUND\n</think>\n\n**RING MEANINGS**: CALL, ECHO, SOUND, SURROUND\n**SMALL**: LITTLE, MICROSCOPIC, MINIATURE, PETITE\n**DOUBLE CONSONANTS**: BUBBLE, COFFEE, PUZZLE, SUMMER\n**JAPANESE LOANWORDS**: BONSAI, KIMONO, MANGA, ORIGAMI"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 7, "original_id": 7, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 3826}}

I notice that CLIMB, DEBT, THUMB, and TOMB all end with a \"B\" that isn't pronounced in standard English. That might be a phonological or orthographic pattern. Also, CHAMBRAY, DENIM, PLAIN, and SATIN seem related to fabrics, as I recognize them as types of cloth. CAN, COULD, DARE, and WOULD look like they could be verbs with similar grammatical functions. Finally, BETTER, BITTER, BRIEF, and BRIGHT all start with \"B,\" but I need to see if there's a deeper connection.\n\nNow, let me check for Lexical Orthography or Phonological Pattern regarding silent letters. Considering CLIMB, DEBT, THUMB, and TOMB, each has a silent \"B\" when pronounced. For example, CLIMB is pronounced without the \"B,\" similarly for DEBT, THUMB, and TOMB. This seems consistent, so these four form a group based on silent \"B\" words.\n\nGroup found: SILENT B WORDS - CLIMB, DEBT, THUMB, TOMB. That leaves me with these 12 words: CHAMBRAY, DENIM, PLAIN, SATIN, CAN, COULD, DARE, WOULD, BETTER, BITTER, BRIEF, BRIGHT.\n\nNext, I see CHAMBRAY, DENIM, PLAIN, and SATIN. These appear to be fabric types. Let me check Semantic Taxonomy: are they all types of fabric weaves? CHAMBRAY is a plain-weave fabric, DENIM is a twill weave, PLAIN refers to plain weave, and SATIN is a satin weave. Yes, they are all common weaves used in textiles. So, this fits as a group of fabric weaves.\n\nGroup found: FABRIC WEAVES - CHAMBRAY, DENIM, PLAIN, SATIN. That leaves me with these 8 words: CAN, COULD, DARE, WOULD, BETTER, BITTER, BRIEF, BRIGHT.\n\nNow, looking at CAN, COULD, DARE, and WOULD. These seem like verbs, but specifically, they might be modal verbs or similar. Let me check Grammatical/Syntactic category. CAN, COULD, and WOULD are standard modal verbs in English, used for ability, possibility, permission, etc. DARE can also function as a modal verb in certain contexts, such as in \"I dare not\" or \"Dare I say?\" where it behaves like a modal. So, these four share the grammatical function of being modal verbs.\n\nGroup found: MODAL VERBS - CAN, COULD, DARE, WOULD. That leaves me with these 4 words: BETTER, BITTER, BRIEF, BRIGHT.\n\nWith only four words left, BETTER, BITTER, BRIEF, and BRIGHT, these must be connected. I notice they all start with the letter \"B,\" but is that sufficient? Let me check for other connections. Semantic Synonymy? They don't have similar meanings; BETTER means superior, BITTER means sharp taste, BRIEF means short, and BRIGHT means shining. Semantic Association? No common scenario links them. Collocational? No obvious shared phrases. Lexical Orthography? They all begin with \"B,\" which is a letter pattern, and in the context of this puzzle, alliteration seems to be the link. Additionally, they are all adjectives, but that might be too broad. Given the pattern, the connection is likely alliteration with \"B.\"\n\nSo, the final group is based on alliteration with \"B.\"\n\nThus, my four groups are:\n\n**SILENT B WORDS**: CLIMB, DEBT, THUMB, TOMB  \n**FABRIC WEAVES**: CHAMBRAY, DENIM, PLAIN, SATIN  \n**MODAL VERBS**: CAN, COULD, DARE, WOULD  \n**ALLITERATION WITH 'B'**: BETTER, BITTER, BRIEF, BRIGHT\n</think>\n\n**SILENT B WORDS**: CLIMB, DEBT, THUMB, TOMB\n**FABRIC WEAVES**: CHAMBRAY, DENIM, PLAIN, SATIN\n**MODAL VERBS**: CAN, COULD, DARE, WOULD\n**ALLITERATION WITH 'B'**: BETTER, BITTER, BRIEF, BRIGHT"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 23, "original_id": 23, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 4126}}

These appear linked by a common scenario. Considering semantic association, they are all elements typically found at a birthday party: BALLOONS for decoration, CANDLES on the cake, GAMES for entertainment, and GUESTS attending. This forms a clear group.\n\nSo, group two: BALLOONS, CANDLES, GAMES, GUESTS \u2013 Birthday Party.\n\nNow, I have 8 words left: CANDLE, LOW, MOON, SUN, FLUTTER, GOODBYE, GREETING, SURGE.\n\nLooking at CANDLE, LOW, MOON, and SUN, I wonder if they share a collocational pattern. I recall that these words can all be combined with \"light\" to form common phrases: CANDLElight, LOW light, MOONlight, and SUNlight. This idiomatic connection makes sense.\n\nSo, group three: CANDLE, LOW, MOON, SUN \u2013 ___ Light.\n\nFinally, I have 4 words left: FLUTTER, GOODBYE, GREETING, SURGE. I need to find their connection. Considering wordplay and multiple meanings, I note that all these words can be associated with different senses of \"wave.\" FLUTTER describes a wave-like motion (e.g., fluttering flags), GOODBYE often involves waving (e.g., waving goodbye), GREETING often involves waving (e.g., waving hello), and SURGE refers to a powerful wave (e.g., a surge of water or energy). This group captures various wave-related meanings.\n\nSo, group four: FLUTTER, GOODBYE, GREETING, SURGE \u2013 Wave Meanings.\n\nThus, my four groups are:\n- **Medical Terminology**: BENIGN, DIAGNOSIS, MALIGNANT, TREATMENT\n- **Birthday Party**: BALLOONS, CANDLES, GAMES, GUESTS\n- **___ Light**: CANDLE, LOW, MOON, SUN\n- **Wave Meanings**: FLUTTER, GOODBYE, GREETING, SURGE\n</think>\n\n**MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY**: BENIGN, DIAGNOSIS, MALIGNANT, TREATMENT\n**___LIGHT**: CANDLE, LOW, MOON, SUN\n**BIRTHDAY PARTY**: BALLOONS, CANDLES, GAMES, GUESTS\n**WAVE MEANINGS**: FLUTTER, GOODBYE, GREETING, SURGE"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 58, "original_id": 58, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 2435}}

I immediately notice that BROWN, COLUMBIA, DUKE, and STANFORD are all well-known universities. That seems like a clear group under Named Entities. Also, OPTS, POTS, STOP, and TOPS all consist of the same letters\u2014S, T, O, P\u2014rearranged, which suggests they might be anagrams. Now, let me check the remaining words systematically.\n\nStarting with Named Entities, I see BROWN, COLUMBIA, DUKE, STANFORD. These are all elite universities in the United States: Brown University, Columbia University, Duke University, and Stanford University. So, that's one group: ELITE UNIVERSITIES.\n\nNow, with those removed, I have ANIMAL, CONFIRM, MARINE, STAMP, OPTS, POTS, STOP, TOPS, BIO, ETYMO, SOCIO, THEO. Next, I'll check Lexical Orthography for anagrams. Looking at OPTS, POTS, STOP, TOPS, I confirm that they are all anagrams of the word \"STOP\". OPTS is a verb meaning chooses, POTS is plural of pot, STOP means to cease, and TOPS means the highest parts\u2014but they all share the same letter set. So, that's another group: ANAGRAMS OF 'STOP'.\n\nAfter removing those, I'm left with ANIMAL, CONFIRM, MARINE, STAMP, BIO, ETYMO, SOCIO, THEO. Now, I'll examine Lexical Morphology. BIO, ETYMO, SOCIO, and THEO all seem to be prefixes or stems that combine with \"-ology\" to form words: biology, etymology, sociology, theology. They share the common pattern of being used in academic disciplines ending in \"-ology\". So, that's a third group: ___OLOGY SUFFIX.\n\nFinally, I have ANIMAL, CONFIRM, MARINE, STAMP. What connects these? I recall that Wordplay Double Meaning might be at play here. The word \"seal\" has multiple meanings: it can refer to an animal (ANIMAL), to confirm or authenticate (CONFIRM), something related to the sea (MARINE), or a stamp or impression (STAMP). So, all these words are associated with different meanings of \"seal\".

Sociolinguistic Register - slang, dialect, jargon\n15. Cross-Linguistic - translations across languages\n\nFirst, let me do a quick visual scan for obvious patterns. I immediately notice that DECADE, EIGHTIES, FORTIES, and SIXTIES all relate to time periods. DECADE is a general term for a ten-year period, while EIGHTIES, FORTIES, and SIXTIES refer to specific decades (1980s, 1940s, 1960s). This seems like a clear example of Semantic Taxonomy\u2014they are all members of the category \"decades.\" So, I'll group them as: DECADE, EIGHTIES, FORTIES, SIXTIES.\n\nWith that group found, I now have 12 words left: ACHIEVE, CHIEF, CONCEIVE, RECEIVE, DOCTOR, LABORATORY, MEDICINE, PATIENT, CEPT, FACE, STATE, STELLAR.\n\nNext, I'll check for Semantic Association. I see DOCTOR, LABORATORY, MEDICINE, and PATIENT\u2014all associated with healthcare or medicine. DOCTOR is a medical professional, LABORATORY is a place for medical testing, MEDICINE is the field or treatment, and PATIENT is the person receiving care. But let me verify if there's a deeper connection. Considering Lexical Etymology, these words all have Latin origins: DOCTOR from \"docere\" (to teach), LABORATORY from \"laborare\" (to work), MEDICINE from \"medicina\" (healing art), and PATIENT from \"pati\" (to suffer). So, they share a common Latin root, which fits under Lexical Etymology. Thus, I'll group them as: DOCTOR, LABORATORY, MEDICINE, PATIENT.\n\nNow, with those removed, I have 8 words left: ACHIEVE, CHIEF, CONCEIVE, RECEIVE, CEPT, FACE, STATE, STELLAR.\n\nI need to find connections among these. Let me look at Phonological Pattern. I notice that ACHIEVE, CHIEF, CONCEIVE, and RECEIVE all contain the \"IE\" or \"EI\" spelling that produces a long \"E\" sound (/i\u02d0/). For example, in ACHIEVE, the \"IE\" is pronounced as /i\u02d0/; in CHIEF, \"IE\" as /i\u02d0/; in CONCEIVE, \"EI\" as /i\u02d0/; and in RECEIVE, \"EI\" as /i\u02d0/. This is a consistent sound pattern, so they could be grouped under Phonological Pattern or Lexical Orthography. I'll group them as: ACHIEVE, CHIEF, CONCEIVE, RECEIVE.\n\nThat leaves me with 4 words: CEPT, FACE, STATE, STELLAR. These must be connected. I recall that in Collocational/Idiomatic patterns, these words can form compounds with the prefix \"inter-\". For example, CEPT becomes INTERCEPT, FACE becomes INTERFACE, STATE becomes INTERSTATE, and STELLAR becomes INTERSTELLAR. So, they all fit into the pattern \"INTER___\", which is a type of Lexical Morphology\u2014shared word formation with a common prefix. Thus, I'll group them as: CEPT, FACE, STATE, STELLAR.\n\nSo my four groups are:\n\n- **DECADES**: DECADE, EIGHTIES, FORTIES, SIXTIES\n- **LATIN ROOTS**: DOCTOR, LABORATORY, MEDICINE, PATIENT\n- **WORDS WITH 'IE' AS LONG 'E'**: ACHIEVE, CHIEF, CONCEIVE, RECEIVE\n- **INTER___ PREFIX**: CEPT, FACE, STATE, STELLAR\n</think>\n\n**DECADES**: DECADE, EIGHTIES, FORTIES, SIXTIES\n**WORDS WITH 'IE' AS LONG 'E'**: ACHIEVE, CHIEF, CONCEIVE, RECEIVE\n**LATIN ROOTS**: DOCTOR, LABORATORY, MEDICINE, PATIENT\n**INTER___ PREFIX**: CEPT, FACE, STATE, STELLAR"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 109, "original_id": 109, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 3776}}

BRUTALIST, CAPE, COLONIAL, and CRAFTSMAN sound like they could be related to architecture.\n\nNow, I'll start with Named Entities since the cities stand out. BEIJING, MOSCOW, SYDNEY, and TOKYO \u2013 all are capital cities or major global cities. But what specifically links them? I recall that all have hosted the Olympic Games: Beijing in 2008, Moscow in 1980, Sydney in 2000, and Tokyo in 1964 and 2020. So, they are Olympic cities. That fits under Named Entities as they are proper names of places with a shared association.\n\nSo, group found: OLYMPIC CITIES. That leaves me with these 12 words: DOZHD, GROZA, RADUGA, SOLNTSE, BRUTALIST, CAPE, COLONIAL, CRAFTSMAN, BEAT, SPENT, WIPED, WORN.\n\nNext, I notice BEAT, SPENT, WIPED, and WORN. Let me check for Semantic Synonymy. These words can all mean tired or exhausted: \"beat\" as in worn out, \"spent\" as drained of energy, \"wiped\" as completely exhausted, and \"worn\" as fatigued. Yes, they are synonyms for \"tired.\" So, this is a clear group under Semantic Synonymy.\n\nGroup found: TIRED. Now I have 8 words left: DOZHD, GROZA, RADUGA, SOLNTSE, BRUTALIST, CAPE, COLONIAL, CRAFTSMAN.\n\nNow, looking at BRUTALIST, CAPE, COLONIAL, and CRAFTSMAN, I suspect they might be architectural styles. Let me verify: Brutalist is an architectural style known for its stark, concrete designs; Cape often refers to Cape Cod style, a type of American house; Colonial is a style from the colonial period; Craftsman is a style emphasizing handcrafted details and natural materials. So, they are all types of architectural styles, which falls under Semantic Taxonomy.\n\nGroup found: ARCHITECTURAL STYLES. That leaves me with 4 words: DOZHD, GROZA, RADUGA, SOLNTSE.\n\nWith only these four left, they must be connected. They look like they might be in Russian, especially since MOSCOW was in the first group. Let me check for Cross-Linguistic connections. I know that \"dozhd\" means \"rain\" in Russian, \"groza\" means \"thunderstorm,\" \"raduga\" means \"rainbow,\" and \"solntse\" means \"sun.\" So, they are all weather-related terms in Russian. This fits under Cross-Linguistic as translations of weather words from Russian.\n\nGroup found: WEATHER IN RUSSIAN. So, all groups are identified.\n\nSo my four groups are:\n\n**WEATHER IN RUSSIAN**: DOZHD, GROZA, RADUGA, SOLNTSE  \n**OLYMPIC CITIES**: BEIJING, MOSCOW, SYDNEY, TOKYO  \n**ARCHITECTURAL STYLES**: BRUTALIST, CAPE, COLONIAL, CRAFTSMAN  \n**TIRED**: BEAT, SPENT, WIPED, WORN\n</think>\n\n**WEATHER IN RUSSIAN**: DOZHD, GROZA, RADUGA, SOLNTSE\n**OLYMPIC CITIES**: BEIJING, MOSCOW, SYDNEY, TOKYO\n**ARCHITECTURAL STYLES**: BRUTALIST, CAPE, COLONIAL, CRAFTSMAN\n**TIRED**: BEAT, SPENT, WIPED, WORN"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 164, "original_id": 164, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 3903}}

I'll systematically check different connection types to find four groups of four related words.\n\nFirst, let me do a quick visual scan for obvious patterns. I immediately notice that DUCK, GOOSE, HORSE, and PIG are all animals, and they seem like common farm animals. This could be a semantic taxonomy group\u2014types of animals found on farms. Let me verify: DUCK is often raised on farms for eggs or meat, GOOSE is similar, HORSE is used for work or riding on farms, and PIG is a staple farm animal. Yes, that fits perfectly.\n\nSo, group 1: DUCK, GOOSE, HORSE, PIG \u2013 farm animals.\n\nNow, with those removed, I have 12 words left: FINANCIAL, MASS, SAVINGS, STORE, FRESHMAN, JUNIOR, KINDERGARTEN, THIRD, BOX, COMPLEX, MIX, RELAX.\n\nNext, I see FRESHMAN, JUNIOR, KINDERGARTEN, and THIRD. These seem related to educational stages. Let me check for semantic taxonomy\u2014are they all academic grades? FRESHMAN is a first-year student in high school or college, JUNIOR is a third-year student, KINDERGARTEN is the first year of formal education, and THIRD likely refers to third grade in elementary school. So, they all represent levels in the academic system. This seems solid.\n\nGroup 2: FRESHMAN, JUNIOR, KINDERGARTEN, THIRD \u2013 academic grades.\n\nNow, I have 8 words left: FINANCIAL, MASS, SAVINGS, STORE, BOX, COMPLEX, MIX, RELAX.\n\nI notice that BOX, COMPLEX, MIX, and RELAX all end with the letter 'X'. This is a lexical orthography pattern\u2014words sharing a common suffix or ending. Let me confirm: BOX ends in 'X', COMPLEX ends in 'X', MIX ends in 'X', and RELAX ends in 'X'. Yes, that's clear and consistent.\n\nGroup 3: BOX, COMPLEX, MIX, RELAX \u2013 words ending in 'X'.\n\nNow, only 4 words remain: FINANCIAL, MASS, SAVINGS, STORE. These must form the last group. I need to find their connection. They don't seem to fit a obvious category like the others, so let me explore semantic associations or wordplay double meanings.\n\nI recall that \"bank\" is a word with multiple meanings, and each of these words can be associated with a different sense of \"bank\". For example, \"financial\" relates to a bank as a financial institution, \"mass\" can relate to a bank as a pile or mound (like a river bank or cloud bank), \"savings\" directly relates to a savings bank, and \"store\" can relate to a bank as a storehouse or repository for money. This seems plausible\u2014they all tie into various meanings of \"bank\".\n\nLet me verify: \n- FINANCIAL: associated with banking in the financial sense.\n- MASS: in geography or geology, a bank can be a mass of earth or snow.\n- SAVINGS: specifically refers to savings accounts in banks.\n- STORE: banks store money and valuables.\n\nYes, this connection holds. So, these words are linked through their association with the multiple meanings of \"bank\".\n\nGroup 4: FINANCIAL, MASS, SAVINGS, STORE \u2013 meanings associated with \"bank\".\n\nSo, my four groups are:\n- Farm animals: DUCK, GOOSE, HORSE, PIG\n- Academic grades: FRESHMAN, JUNIOR, KINDERGARTEN, THIRD\n- Words ending in 'X': BOX, COMPLEX, MIX, RELAX\n- Bank meanings: FINANCIAL, MASS, SAVINGS, STORE\n</think>\n\n**BANK MEANINGS**: FINANCIAL, MASS, SAVINGS, STORE\n**ACADEMIC GRADES**: FRESHMAN, JUNIOR, KINDERGARTEN, THIRD\n**WORDS ENDING IN 'X'**: BOX, COMPLEX, MIX, RELAX\n**FARM ANIMALS**: DUCK, GOOSE, HORSE, PIG"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 174, "original_id": 174, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 3197}}

I notice that DIX, SEPT, UN, and VINGT look like French words. Let me check for Cross-Linguistic connections. DIX means ten, SEPT means seven, UN means one, and VINGT means twenty in French. So, these are all numbers in French. That seems like a solid group.\n\nNow, with that group identified, I have these words left: BARBECUE, CHOCOLATE, HURRICANE, MAIZE, EIGHTH, HUNDREDTH, QUARTER, THIRD, GLUE, HIGHLIGHTER, MARKER, SCISSORS.\n\nNext, I see EIGHTH, HUNDREDTH, QUARTER, and THIRD. These seem related to fractions or parts of a whole. Let me check for Semantic Taxonomy. EIGHTH is 1/8, HUNDREDTH is 1/100, QUARTER is 1/4, and THIRD is 1/3. So, they are all fractions.

Let me check for Semantic Association. GLUE is used for adhesion, HIGHLIGHTER for emphasizing text, MARKER for writing or drawing, and SCISSORS for cutting. They are all associated with school or office scenarios. So, that seems like another group.\n\nThat leaves BARBECUE, CHOCOLATE, HURRICANE, and MAIZE. What connects these? They don't seem to share an obvious category at first glance. Let me consider Lexical Etymology. I recall that these words have origins in Native American languages. BARBECUE comes from the Taino word \"barbacoa,\" CHOCOLATE from the Nahuatl word \"xocolatl,\" HURRICANE from the Taino word \"huracan,\" and MAIZE from the Taino word \"mahiz.\" So, they are all loanwords from Native American languages.

I notice FOMO, HASHTAG, SELFIE, and YOLO \u2013 these seem like modern terms often used online. Also, ANE, ITOKO, KAZOKU, and SOFU sound like they might be from Japanese. SCORE, STAND, SYMPHONY, and WOODWIND could be music-related, and QUARTERLY, SEASONAL, SOLSTICE, and SUMMER might relate to time or seasons.\n\nNow, I'll start with Semantic Taxonomy. Could there be groups based on categories? Let me check SCORE, STAND, SYMPHONY, WOODWIND. In an orchestra context, \"score\" refers to written music, \"stand\" might be a music stand, \"symphony\" is a type of orchestral composition, and \"woodwind\" is a family of instruments. So, these all relate to orchestra sections or components. Testing: SCORE is associated with musical notation, STAND is used to hold sheet music, SYMPHONY is performed by an orchestra, and WOODWIND is a section within an orchestra. Yes, these are all connected to orchestra.\n\nThat gives me one group: SCORE, STAND, SYMPHONY, WOODWIND related to orchestra.\n\nNow, with those removed, I have: FOMO, HASHTAG, SELFIE, YOLO, ANE, ITOKO, KAZOKU, SOFU, QUARTERLY, SEASONAL, SOLSTICE, SUMMER.\n\nNext, I'll check Sociolinguistic Register \u2013 slang, dialect, jargon. FOMO, HASHTAG, SELFIE, and YOLO stand out as internet slang. FOMO means \"fear of missing out,\" HASHTAG is a social media tag, SELFIE is a self-taken photograph, and YOLO means \"you only live once.\" These are all commonly used in online communication and modern slang. So, this seems like a solid group: FOMO, HASHTAG, SELFIE, YOLO as internet slang.\n\nThat's another group found. Now, I have: ANE, ITOKO, KAZOKU, SOFU, QUARTERLY, SEASONAL, SOLSTICE, SUMMER.\n\nNow, I'll check Cross-Linguistic \u2013 translations across languages. ANE, ITOKO, KAZOKU, SOFU appear to be Japanese words. Let me verify: ANE means \"older sister,\" ITOKO means \"cousin,\" KAZOKU means \"family,\" and SOFU means \"grandfather.\" So, these are all terms for family relationships in Japanese. Yes, that fits.\n\nSo, group three: ANE, ITOKO, KAZOKU, SOFU as family terms in Japanese.\n\nNow, only four words left: QUARTERLY, SEASONAL, SOLSTICE, SUMMER. These must be connected. Let me check Temporal/Sequential or Semantic Taxonomy. QUARTERLY relates to quarters of the year, SEASONAL relates to seasons, SOLSTICE is an astronomical event that marks the start of summer or winter, and SUMMER is a season. So, they are all associated with seasons or periodic time cycles. Specifically, QUARTERLY implies a division of the year, SEASONAL describes something related to seasons, SOLSTICE is a key seasonal point, and SUMMER is a specific season. This group fits under seasons or temporal concepts.\n\nThus, the final group: QUARTERLY, SEASONAL, SOLSTICE, SUMMER related to seasons.\n\nSo my four groups are:\n\n**ORCHESTRA SECTIONS**: SCORE, STAND, SYMPHONY, WOODWIND  \n**INTERNET SLANG**: FOMO, HASHTAG, SELFIE, YOLO  \n**FAMILY IN JAPANESE**: ANE, ITOKO, KAZOKU, SOFU  \n**SEASONS**: QUARTERLY, SEASONAL, SOLSTICE, SUMMER\n</think>\n\n**ORCHESTRA SECTIONS**: SCORE, STAND, SYMPHONY, WOODWIND\n**INTERNET SLANG**: FOMO, HASHTAG, SELFIE, YOLO\n**FAMILY IN JAPANESE**: ANE, ITOKO, KAZOKU, SOFU\n**SEASONS**: QUARTERLY, SEASONAL, SOLSTICE, SUMMER"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 29, "original_id": 29, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 4107}}

I notice that DIES, IOVIS, SOLIS, and VENERIS all seem related to Latin, possibly days of the week or Roman mythology. Also, ALPHABET, NEPHEW, PHOENIX, and PROPHET all contain \"PH,\" which is often pronounced as \"F\" in English. ACT, CEPT, PERSONAL, and STELLAR might be word roots or parts that combine with prefixes. BLUEPRINT, CONCRETE, EXCAVATOR, and SCAFFOLD all evoke construction or building sites.\n\nNow, I'll check for semantic association. Considering BLUEPRINT, CONCRETE, EXCAVATOR, and SCAFFOLD, these are all items linked by a shared scenario: a construction site. A blueprint is a plan for construction, concrete is a building material, an excavator is machinery for digging, and a scaffold is a temporary platform for workers. So, this seems like a solid group: CONSTRUCTION SITE.\n\nWith that group identified, I have 12 words left: DIES, IOVIS, SOLIS, VENERIS, ALPHABET, NEPHEW, PHOENIX, PROPHET, ACT, CEPT, PERSONAL, STELLAR.\n\nNext, I'll check for lexical morphology, specifically shared affixes or word formation. Looking at ACT, CEPT, PERSONAL, and STELLAR, I see that these can all be prefixed with \"inter-\" to form common words: interact, intercept, interpersonal, and interstellar. So, these are all words that complete the \"inter___\" pattern. This group seems clear: INTER___ PREFIX.\n\nNow, with that group found, I have 8 words left: DIES, IOVIS, SOLIS, VENERIS, ALPHABET, NEPHEW, PHOENIX, PROPHET.\n\nI'll check for phonological patterns. ALPHABET, NEPHEW, PHOENIX, and PROPHET all contain the \"PH\" letter combination, which is pronounced as an \"F\" sound in English. This is a consistent orthographic and phonological pattern: WORDS WITH 'PH' AS 'F'.\n\nThat leaves me with 4 words: DIES, IOVIS, SOLIS, VENERIS. These must be connected. I'll check for cross-linguistic connections or semantic taxonomy. These appear to be Latin words related to days. DIES means \"day\" in Latin, and IOVIS, SOLIS, and VENERIS are genitive forms used in Latin day names: Dies Iovis (Thursday), Dies Solis (Sunday), and Dies Veneris (Friday). So, together, they represent DAYS IN LATIN.\n\nThus, all groups are confirmed.\n\nSo my four groups are:\n\n**DAYS IN LATIN**: DIES, IOVIS, SOLIS, VENERIS  \n**WORDS WITH 'PH' AS 'F'**: ALPHABET, NEPHEW, PHOENIX, PROPHET  \n**INTER___ PREFIX**: ACT, CEPT, PERSONAL, STELLAR  \n**CONSTRUCTION SITE**: BLUEPRINT, CONCRETE, EXCAVATOR, SCAFFOLD\n</think>\n\n**DAYS IN LATIN**: DIES, IOVIS, SOLIS, VENERIS\n**WORDS WITH 'PH' AS 'F'**: ALPHABET, NEPHEW, PHOENIX, PROPHET\n**INTER___ PREFIX**: ACT, CEPT, PERSONAL, STELLAR\n**CONSTRUCTION SITE**: BLUEPRINT, CONCRETE, EXCAVATOR, SCAFFOLD"}], "metadata": {"puzzle_id": 8, "original_id": 8, "permutation": 0, "reasoning_length": 2690}}
