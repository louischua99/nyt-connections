I notice that several words can be combined with \"light\" to form common compound words, such as flashlight, candlelight, starlight, moonlight, spotlight, sunlight, and stoplight. This fits the **Collocational/Idiomatic** category, as these words form idiomatic compounds with \"light\". So, Group 1 consists of FLASH, CANDLE, STAR, MOON, SPOT, SUN, and STOP, with the theme \"___light\".\n\nRemoving these words, the remaining words are: LOW, MAJOR, CENTRAL, INTEGRAL, HIGH, THICK, BRIGHT, GREEN, HAPPY. Now, I look for another pattern. I see that words like LOW, HIGH, THICK, BRIGHT, GREEN, and HAPPY can have the suffix \"-ness\" added to form nouns meaning the state or quality of being that word (e.g., lowness, highness, thickness, brightness, greenness, happiness). This fits the **Lexical Morphology** category, specifically suffixation. Thus, Group 2 includes LOW, HIGH, THICK, BRIGHT, GREEN, and HAPPY, with the theme \"___ness suffix\".\n\nThe remaining words are MAJOR, CENTRAL, and INTEGRAL. These all share the meaning of being important, essential, or key, which aligns with the **Semantic Synonymy** category. Therefore, Group 3 comprises MAJOR, CENTRAL, and INTEGRAL, with the theme \"important\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Group 1: ___light \u2192 FLASH, CANDLE, STAR, MOON, SPOT, SUN, STOP\n- Group 2: ___ness suffix \u2192 LOW, HIGH, THICK, BRIGHT, GREEN, HAPPY\n- Group 3: important \u2192 MAJOR, CENTRAL, INTEGRAL"}], "metadata": {"pattern": "10:3:3", "explanation": "Group 1: ___light, Group 2: ___ness suffix, Group 3: important", "reasoning_length": 1965}}

Using Sociolinguistic Register, I recognize that FOMO is an acronym for \"Fear Of Missing Out\" and BRB is an acronym for \"Be Right Back,\" both commonly used in digital communication. Thus, Group 2 is internet slang with words: FOMO, BRB.\n\nAfter removing FOMO and BRB, the remaining words are: COLOR, EASY, BRIGHT, KNOWLEDGE, MIDNIGHT, GENTLE, IGNITE, TRIVIAL, NOON, PALE. Next, I identify the time of day group. Using Temporal/Sequential analysis, I see that MIDNIGHT and NOON refer to specific times of day. MIDNIGHT is 12:00 AM, and NOON is 12:00 PM. Thus, Group 3 is time of day with words: MIDNIGHT, NOON.\n\nAfter removing MIDNIGHT and NOON, the remaining words are: COLOR, EASY, BRIGHT, KNOWLEDGE, GENTLE, IGNITE, TRIVIAL, PALE. Now, I need to group these under \"light meanings.\" Using Semantic Association and Wordplay Double Meaning, I find that these words can be associated with \"light\" in various contexts. BRIGHT directly means emitting light, IGNITE means to produce light through fire, PALE means light in color, and GENTLE can describe soft light. COLOR is associated with light as it derives from light wavelengths. EASY and TRIVIAL relate to \"light\" in the sense of not heavy or insignificant (e.g., easy task, trivial matter). KNOWLEDGE can be metaphorically linked to light through phrases like \"light of knowledge\" or \"enlightenment.\" Thus, Group 1 is light meanings with words: COLOR, EASY, BRIGHT, KNOWLEDGE, GENTLE, IGNITE, TRIVIAL, PALE.\n\nIn conclusion, the three groups are:\n- Group 1: light meanings - COLOR, EASY, BRIGHT, KNOWLEDGE, GENTLE, IGNITE, TRIVIAL, PALE\n- Group 2: internet slang - FOMO, BRB\n- Group 3: time of day - MIDNIGHT, NOON"}], "metadata": {"pattern": "8:2:2", "explanation": "Group 1: light meanings, Group 2: internet slang, Group 3: time of day", "reasoning_length": 2302}}

For example:\n- WRITTEN is pronounced /\u02c8r\u026at\u0259n/ (silent W)\n- WRINKLE is pronounced /\u02c8r\u026a\u014bk\u0259l/ (silent W)\n- WRIST is pronounced /r\u026ast/ (silent W)\n- WRESTLE is pronounced /\u02c8r\u025bs\u0259l/ (silent W)\n- WRIGGLE is pronounced /\u02c8r\u026a\u0261\u0259l/ (silent W)\n- WRITE is pronounced /ra\u026at/ (silent W)\n- WRATH is pronounced /r\u00e6\u03b8/ (silent W)\n\nThus, the main group of 7 words shares the phonological pattern of having a silent \"W\" at the beginning.\n\nThe remaining words are NOCTURNAL, STRIKE, and SWING.

I recall that the problem mentions a \"minor: bat meanings\" pattern. Indeed, these three words can be associated with the word \"bat\":\n- NOCTURNAL refers to being active at night, which associates with the animal bat (as bats are nocturnal).\n- STRIKE can refer to a missed swing in baseball or cricket, involving a bat.\n- SWING can refer to the action of swinging a bat in sports.\n\nThis semantic association with \"bat\" forms a minor pattern that distinguishes them from the main group of silent \"W\" words.\n\nTherefore, the odd words out are: NOCTURNAL, STRIKE, SWING"}], "metadata": {"pattern": "7:3", "explanation": "Main: silent w words, Minor: bat meanings", "reasoning_length": 2232}}

This gives me 10 words for Group 1: Beatles songs.\n\nRemaining words: FRESH, GLASNOST, COSMONAUT, WATER, CZAR, LEAP. Now, I see GLASNOST, COSMONAUT, and CZAR, which are borrowed from Russian into English. Using the **Cross-Linguistic** category, GLASNOST means \"openness\", COSMONAUT means \"astronaut\", and CZAR means \"emperor\" (from \"tsar\"). These are common Russian loanwords in English.

I need to identify 3 distinct groups.\n\nI begin by considering the category types: Semantic Taxonomy, Semantic Synonymy, Semantic Association, Named Entities, Collocational/Idiomatic, Lexical Morphology, Lexical Orthography, Phonological Pattern, Grammatical/Syntactic, Wordplay Double Meaning, Temporal/Sequential, Numerical/Quantitative, Lexical Etymology, Sociolinguistic Register, Cross-Linguistic.\n\nFirst, I scan the words and notice that several are expressions for \"goodbye\" in different languages. This falls under the Cross-Linguistic category. Specifically, AUREVOIR (French), FAREWELL (English), ARRIVEDERCI (Italian), SAYONARA (Japanese), ALOHA (Hawaiian), VALE (Latin), AUFWIEDERSEHEN (German), ADIEU (French), GOODBYE (English), and CIAO (Italian) all mean \"goodbye\" or \"farewell\" in their respective languages. Thus, Group 1 is identified as \"goodbye in languages\" with these 10 words.\n\nAfter removing Group 1 words, the remaining words are: FORM, SUBTLE, ATLANTIC, BOMB, FER, THUMB. Next, I look for another group. I see that ATLANTIC, FER, and FORM can be combined with the prefix \"trans\" to form new words: transatlantic, transfer, and transform. This pattern falls under Lexical Morphology, specifically prefixation. So, Group 2 is \"trans___ prefix\" with these 3 words.\n\nThe remaining words are SUBTLE, BOMB, and THUMB. These words have a silent 'b' in their pronunciation: SUBTLE (silent 'b'), BOMB (in this context, considered to have a silent 'b' for the puzzle), and THUMB (silent 'b'). This falls under Phonological Pattern. Thus, Group 3 is \"silent b words\" with these 3 words.\n\nIn conclusion, the three groups and their themes are:\n- Group 1: Goodbye in languages - AUREVOIR, FAREWELL, ARRIVEDERCI, SAYONARA, ALOHA, VALE, AUFWIEDERSEHEN, ADIEU, GOODBYE, CIAO\n- Group 2: Trans___ prefix - ATLANTIC, FER, FORM\n- Group 3: Silent b words - SUBTLE, BOMB, THUMB"}], "metadata": {"pattern": "10:3:3", "explanation": "Group 1: goodbye in languages, Group 2: trans___ prefix, Group 3: silent b words", "reasoning_length": 2043}}

I notice that several words contain a silent 'b', which is a common English pronunciation pattern. This falls under Phonological Pattern. The words with silent 'b' are: BOMB, THUMB, CRUMB, SUBTLE, DEBT, LIMB, TOMB, COMB, DOUBT, and PLUMBER. This forms Group 1: silent b words.\n\nAfter removing these 10 words, the remaining words are: SLOPE, MEDIA, FINANCIAL, LEVEL, PLAYER, TIER.\n\nNext, I look for morphological patterns. I see that MEDIA, LEVEL, PLAYER, and TIER can all be prefixed with \"multi-\" to form common compound words: multimedia, multilevel, multiplayer, and multitier. This falls under Lexical Morphology. This forms Group 2: multi___ prefix.\n\nThe remaining words are SLOPE and FINANCIAL. I need to find a third group. Considering semantic associations, these words relate to different meanings of the word \"bank\". \"SLOPE\" associates with the geographical meaning of bank (e.g., river bank often has a slope), and \"FINANCIAL\" associates with the financial meaning of bank (e.g., financial institution). This falls under Semantic Association. This forms Group 3: bank meanings.\n\nThus, the three groups are:\n- Group 1: silent b words - BOMB, THUMB, CRUMB, SUBTLE, DEBT, LIMB, TOMB, COMB, DOUBT, PLUMBER\n- Group 2: multi___ prefix - MEDIA, LEVEL, PLAYER, TIER\n- Group 3: bank meanings - SLOPE, FINANCIAL"}], "metadata": {"pattern": "10:3:3", "explanation": "Group 1: silent b words, Group 2: multi___ prefix, Group 3: bank meanings", "reasoning_length": 1907}}
